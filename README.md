# ACInternal
This repository contains an internal cheat for Assault Cube, leveraging MinHook to hook into the game's functions and display an ImGui overlay. This overlay provides real-time statistics of the local player, such as health, ammo, and more. For the injection mechanism, a LoadLibrary-style DLL injector is included to facilitate injecting the cheat into the Assault Cube process.

The primary purpose of this cheat is educational, aimed at demonstrating how to hook functions effectively and how to implement a real-time updating ImGui overlay.
